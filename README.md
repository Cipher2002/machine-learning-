### 3 BASIC ALGOS ARE:
     
1. LINEAR REGRESSION : SO BASICALLY THIS ALGO GIVES YOU THE BEST LINE THAT COREESPONDS TO THE DATA WHICH HELPS YOU FIND THE ACCURACY OF THE DATA.
     
2. K NEAREST NEIGHBORS (KNN) : THIS ALGO USES AN INTEGER K AND FINDS THE K AMOUNT OF NEAREST NEIGHBORS AND FINDS WHERE THE K WILL BELONG IN THE GROUP AND TELLS YOU THE ACCURACY
     
3. SOFT VECTOR MACHINE (SVM) : SO BASICALLY SVM (SOFT VECTOR MACHINE) IS USED TO ORDER THE UNORDERED DATA AS IN CONVERT THE 2D DATA INTO 3D DATA SO THAT THE DATA THAT IS IN LINE/BETWEEN EACH OTHER\ MAKE THEM SHOOT UP SHOOT DOWN SO THAT ALL THE DIFFERENT TYPE OF DATA IS TOGETHER. SOFT MARGIN IS A PARAMETER IS A PARAMETER THAT WE SET THAT IS ALLOWED TO BE
	IN THE SOFT MARGIN THAT LIE BETWEEN THE TWO POINTS CLOSEST TO THE HYPERPLANE. THIS ALLOWS THE DATA FROM DIFFERENT GROUP BE WITH ANOTHER GROUP
